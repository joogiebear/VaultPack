# Aurora

This is the base plugin for every Aurora plugin.
It requires **PaperMC** as the server software and **Java 21** or higher.
In theory folia is also supported, but it is not tested yet.

You can view the full documentation [here](https://docs.auroramc.gg/aurora).

It provides the following utilities:
- chat/actionbar messaging, text building using every possible color formats and styles.
- custom logger
- automatic yaml to class mapping and config versioning
- plugin dependency management
- inventory menu/gui builder with premade configs
- user data management via file or mysql (mysql can sync between servers as well)
- builtin user metadata store with placeholder support
- economy expansion with builtin providers (CMI, EssentialsX, Vault)
- placeholder expansion to interact with PAPI
- configurable number formatting
- player placed block tracker (supporting flatfile or sqlite as storage) 
which integrates with Multiverse-Core and WildRegeneration for cleanup. It can even handle manual chunk deletions.
- WorldGuard expansion to provide events like `PlayerRegionEnterEvent` and `PlayerRegionLeaveEvent`
- `CommandDispatcher` to easily dispatch commands from config files
- Leaderboard expansion with APIs to handle multiple leaderboards
